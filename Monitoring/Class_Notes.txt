	Fundamentals of Prometheus and Grafana
	
	Continuous Monitoring :
		- It is used to monitor the infra-structure and Applications based on the monitorig frequency
		
		- Infra-Structure Monitoring
			- Prometheus/Grafana/Dyna-trace/Nagios/Splunk
			- Used ot Monitor the CPU/Memory utilizations
			
		- Application Monitoring 
		
			- AppDynamics / DataDog	
			
	- Production Support / Monitoring Team 		==> 24/7 need for production
			
	Production Server :::	-> req. no. of cpus, ram ..
	
		- Deploy the applications
	
	
	
		Prometheus 	==> Monitoring Tool 
		
		Grafana 	==> Visualization Tool 
	
	
	Architecture of Monitoring Tool :::
	
		- Prometheus Architecture - monitoring server will having in-build database that databse used store the metrix that are pulled from the agent
                                            and from the datatbase you can able to transfer the data to Grafana for creating the dashbord
                                            and additional to it we can set some alerts
		
			- Time Series Database 		===================> 	Grafana 
			
			- PromQL
			
		- Install and Configure Prometheus and Grafana 
				run as a web services 
				
				https://prometheus.io/download/
		
		
		
		- Create Monitoring Dashboards using Grafana 
		
Next :

			Setup Prometheus, Node Exporter & Grafana
			Create Grafana Dashbroads
